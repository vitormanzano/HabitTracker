# HabitTracker
A habit tracker to handle your habits easily

# What will I build?

My goal in this project is to build a web application to handle habits. This app will
allow you to view your habits, mark when you perform a habit, and check how many
times you have performed this habit.

Check more in the Wiki!

# How can I access the Wiki?
In the top bar of the page, you'll see many services in my repository, find the one that
looks like a book and is called Wiki
